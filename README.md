### MPC based ACC using Matlab
A Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach is implemented on a basic Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system. A vehicle is moving with a constant velocity and an ego vehicle approaches the leading vehicle and should maintain the same velocity. Using an MPC controller, the required stability with the specified input constraints and the target velocity for a constant preceding vehicle velocity is achieved. Through simulations in MATLAB, it is shown that the proposed MPC strategy can maintain a vehicle in designated constraints.
